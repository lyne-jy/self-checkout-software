# SENG 300 Group M Project Iteration 3
## Description
This repository contains the source code for a control software for a self-checkout station as well and JUnit test for this software. This application uses a series of facades to provide various functionalities as well as the observer design pattern for notification of events.

We are using a 3-tier layered architecture. In the first layer we have the Hardware Facade. The second layer consists of the Communication, Products, and Funds Facades. They are self-contained elements of software components. Lastly, the third layer consists of the coordination facade, which governs the interactions between individual facades within the second layer.
